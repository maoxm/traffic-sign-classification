# ## Step 0: Load The Data

# In[184]:

# Load pickled data
import pickle

# TODO: Fill this in based on where you saved the training and testing data

training_file = "data/train.p"
testing_file = "data/test.p"

with open(training_file, mode='rb') as f:
    train = pickle.load(f)
with open(testing_file, mode='rb') as f:
    test = pickle.load(f)
    
X_train, y_train = train['features'], train['labels']
X_test, y_test = test['features'], test['labels']


# ---
# 
# ## Step 1: Dataset Summary & Exploration
# 
# The pickled data is a dictionary with 4 key/value pairs:
# 
# - `'features'` is a 4D array containing raw pixel data of the traffic sign images, (num examples, width, height, channels).
# - `'labels'` is a 1D array containing the label/class id of the traffic sign. The file `signnames.csv` contains id -> name mappings for each id.
# - `'sizes'` is a list containing tuples, (width, height) representing the the original width and height the image.
# - `'coords'` is a list containing tuples, (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing coordinates of a bounding box around the sign in the image. **THESE COORDINATES ASSUME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE PICKLED DATA CONTAINS RESIZED VERSIONS (32 by 32) OF THESE IMAGES**
# 
# Complete the basic data summary below.

# Visualize the German Traffic Signs Dataset using the pickled file(s). This is open ended, suggestions include: plotting traffic sign images, plotting the count of each sign, etc.
# 
# The [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) [examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html) and [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) pages are a great resource for doing visualizations in Python.
# 
# **NOTE:** It's recommended you start with something simple first. If you wish to do more, come back to it after you've completed the rest of the sections.

### Data exploration visualization goes here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Visualizations will be shown in the notebook.
get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')


# ----
# 
# ## Step 2: Design and Test a Model Architecture
# 
# Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test your model on the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
# 
# There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:
# 
# - Neural network architecture
# - Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)
# - Number of examples per label (some have more than others).
# - Generate fake data.
# 
# Here is an example of a [published baseline model on this problem](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). It's not required to be familiar with the approach used in the paper but, it's good practice to try to read papers like these.
# 
# **NOTE:** The LeNet-5 implementation shown in the [classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/601ae704-1035-4287-8b11-e2c2716217ad/concepts/d4aca031-508f-4e0b-b493-e7b706120f81) at the end of the CNN lesson is a solid starting point. You'll have to change the number of classes and possibly the preprocessing, but aside from that it's plug and play!

# ### Implementation

# 
# Use the code cell (or multiple code cells, if necessary) to implement the first step of your project. Once you have completed your implementation and are satisfied with the results, be sure to thoroughly answer the questions that follow.

# ### Question 4
# 
# _How did you train your model? (Type of optimizer, batch size, epochs, hyperparameters, etc.)_
# 

# **Answer:**
# 
# Using gradient decent optimizer( should try adam optimazer). The batch size is 100 to fit everything into memory. Epoch is 30~40. If more the accuracy starts to going up and down. I used 4 levels of conv net and 3 levels full connect graph combined with LeNet and AlexNet.
# 

# ### Question 5
# 
# 
# _What approach did you take in coming up with a solution to this problem? It may have been a process of trial and error, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think this is suitable for the current problem._

# **Answer:**
# I think this problem is more complated than letter recognization so I used more features by increasing filter count
# 1. I tried 32, 64, 128 as conv net filter and two full connect layers from 2048 to 512 to n_classes(42). Starting ephco 30 the accuracy is around 0.8 and increasing slowly. So I stopped there.
# 2. Then I tried add one more layer of CNN
# 3. Originally I used gray picture but I changed it back to rgb 3 colors. And the result seems better.

# ---
# 
# ## Step 3: Test a Model on New Images
# 
# Take several pictures of traffic signs that you find on the web or around you (at least five), and run them through your classifier on your computer to produce example results. The classifier might not recognize some local signs but it could prove interesting nonetheless.
# 
# You may find `signnames.csv` useful as it contains mappings from the class id (integer) to the actual sign name.

# ### Implementation
# 
# Use the code cell (or multiple code cells, if necessary) to implement the first step of your project. Once you have completed your implementation and are satisfied with the results, be sure to thoroughly answer the questions that follow.

# In[192]:

### Load the images and plot them here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cv2

files = ["t/t1.jpeg", "t/t2.jpeg", "t/t3.jpeg", "t/t4.jpeg", "t/t5.jpeg"]
manual_y = [
    7, # speed limit 100
    17, # no entry
    17, # no entry
    0, # speed limit 20
    13  # yeld
]

manual_x = []
for each in files:
    plt.figure()
    image = mpimg.imread(each)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (32, 32))
    plt.imshow(image)
    manual_x.append(preprocess(image))

print(manual_x[4].shape)


# ### Question 6
# 
# _Choose five candidate images of traffic signs and provide them in the report. Are there any particular qualities of the image(s) that might make classification difficult? It could be helpful to plot the images in the notebook._
# 
# 

# **Answer:**
# The quality of picture doesn't quite matter because we need to resize them to 32x32 anyway.

# In[193]:

# test set
myX_test = []

def eval_my_collection(X_data, y_data):

eval_my_collection(manual_x, manual_y)
#eval_my_collection(myX_vali[:10], y_vali[:10])

#w
#print(myX_vali[0], y_vali[0])


# ### Question 7
# 
# _Is your model able to perform equally well on captured pictures when compared to testing on the dataset? The simplest way to do this check the accuracy of the predictions. For example, if the model predicted 1 out of 5 signs correctly, it's 20% accurate._
# 
# _**NOTE:** You could check the accuracy manually by using `signnames.csv` (same directory). This file has a mapping from the class id (0-42) to the corresponding sign name. So, you could take the class id the model outputs, lookup the name in `signnames.csv` and see if it matches the sign from the image._
# 

# **Answer:**
# No. The model only predict as 20% accuracy on the captured pictures.

# In[196]:

### Visualize the softmax probabilities here.
### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed.
top_k = tf.nn.top_k(logits, k=5)
with tf.Session() as sess:
        saver.restore(sess, "./myModel_30")
        predict_k = sess.run(top_k, feed_dict={x: manual_x, y: manual_y})
        print(predict_k)


# ### Question 8
# 
# *Use the model's softmax probabilities to visualize the **certainty** of its predictions, [`tf.nn.top_k`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/nn.html#top_k) could prove helpful here. Which predictions is the model certain of? Uncertain? If the model was incorrect in its initial prediction, does the correct prediction appear in the top k? (k should be 5 at most)*
# 
# `tf.nn.top_k` will return the values and indices (class ids) of the top k predictions. So if k=3, for each sign, it'll return the 3 largest probabilities (out of a possible 43) and the correspoding class ids.
# 
# Take this numpy array as an example:
# 
# ```
# # (5, 6) array
# a = np.array([[ 0.24879643,  0.07032244,  0.12641572,  0.34763842,  0.07893497,
#          0.12789202],
#        [ 0.28086119,  0.27569815,  0.08594638,  0.0178669 ,  0.18063401,
#          0.15899337],
#        [ 0.26076848,  0.23664738,  0.08020603,  0.07001922,  0.1134371 ,
#          0.23892179],
#        [ 0.11943333,  0.29198961,  0.02605103,  0.26234032,  0.1351348 ,
#          0.16505091],
#        [ 0.09561176,  0.34396535,  0.0643941 ,  0.16240774,  0.24206137,
#          0.09155967]])
# ```
# 
# Running it through `sess.run(tf.nn.top_k(tf.constant(a), k=3))` produces:
# 
# ```
# TopKV2(values=array([[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202],
#        [ 0.28086119,  0.27569815,  0.18063401],
#        [ 0.26076848,  0.23892179,  0.23664738],
#        [ 0.29198961,  0.26234032,  0.16505091],
#        [ 0.34396535,  0.24206137,  0.16240774]]), indices=array([[3, 0, 5],
#        [0, 1, 4],
#        [0, 5, 1],
#        [1, 3, 5],
#        [1, 4, 3]], dtype=int32))
# ```
# 
# Looking just at the first row we get `[ 0.34763842,  0.24879643,  0.12789202]`, you can confirm these are the 3 largest probabilities in `a`. You'll also notice `[3, 0, 5]` are the corresponding indices.

# **Answer:**
# 1. The correct prediction (3rd pic) it is fairly certain it is no entry sign as the 2nd value much less that the top 1st in the softmax(26. vs 47.)
# 2. The 2nd and 5th picture got correct prediction on the 2nd value.
# 3. The 1st and 4th picture has no correct prediction in the top 5 value. I would guess maybe those kind of speed limit sign has less training pictures in the training set.
